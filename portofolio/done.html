	<h1>my facilities</h1>
	<p>The technology in facilities management includes both software and systems. Vast amounts of data are generated by built environments through Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, wi-fi,  meters, gauges, and smart devices. The most effective solutions enable facilities management departments to make good use of this data by infusing analytics<br> and artificial intelligence (AI) into an Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS). These technologies deliver cognitive<br> capabilities that make computer-aided facilities management possible â€” so you can analyze and learn from data, enabling you to achieve real-time visibility, perform predictive facilities maintenance, and create more productive, cost-efficient environments.</p>
